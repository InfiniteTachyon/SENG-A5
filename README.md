# Introduction
For this lab, our group was tasked to familiarize ourselves with realiability assessment tools such as C-SFRAT and the Reliability Demonstration Chart. As part of this, we will learn how to use failure reliability growth testing to help analyze a product's change overtime. Additionally, the analysis of failure data can aid in its future prevention.

# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 

# Assessment Using Reliability Demonstration Chart 

# 

# Comparison of Results

# Discussion on Similarity and Differences of the Two Techniques

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed
Due to the difficulty with the software installation, it was decided that this lab would be collaborated on all together, rather than splitting up the work. We started by trying SRTAT, but we eventually transitioned to using C-SFRAT despite requiring to convert the files to csvs because we found it easier and more elegant to use.
