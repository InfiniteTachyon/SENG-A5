# Introduction
For this lab, our group was tasked to familiarize ourselves with realiability assessment tools such as C-SFRAT and the Reliability Demonstration Chart. As part of this, we will learn how to use failure reliability growth testing to help analyze a product's change overtime. Additionally, the analysis of failure data can aid in its future prevention.

# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 

# Assessment Using Reliability Demonstration Chart

# Comparison of Results

# Discussion on Similarity and Differences of the Two Techniques

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed
To start, we all installed the necessary tools for this lab and made sure each member of the team knew how to use each tool. We then split into 2 groups, with Bismarck and David working on Part 1, and Chachi and Zirui working on Part 2. For Part 1, we started by trying SRTAT, but we eventually transitioned to using C-SFRAT despite requiring to convert the files to csvs because we found it easier and more elegant to use. Then, omce all the necessarily data was ran through the tools, we all worked together to compile this lab write-up.
